# STRINGS' NOTES
* String is the most commonly used class in java's class library.
* Everything that starts with a capital letter is a class.
* Every string you creates is actually an object of class String.
* String name = "Shruti Sharma" ; //here String is datatype, name is reference variable, and "Shruti Sharma" is object.
## 2 Concepts :
* 1. String Pool is a separate memory structure inside the heap.
Example : String a = "Kunal";
          String b = "Kunal";
